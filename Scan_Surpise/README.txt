Description
I've gotten bored of handing out flags as text. Wouldn't it be cool if they were an image instead?

SOLUTION:

1. open the file as an image
2. Scan the QR code with a phone; flag is the embedded message

Alternatley:

1. If a no mobile phone is available, use the linux tool: 'zbarimg' to read the embedded data.
